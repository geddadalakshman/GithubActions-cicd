Functions:
GitHub offers a set of built-in functions that you can use in expressions. Some functions cast values to a string to perform comparisons. GitHub casts data types to a string using these conversions:
Null    --->    ''
Boolean --->    'true' or 'false'
Number  --->    Decimal format, exponential for large numbers
Array   --->    Arrays are not converted to a string
Object  --->    Objects are not converted to a string
